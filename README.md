# chicago-parking-visualizations

Using a massive dataset of parking violations in the city of Chicago, I try to create meaningful and interesting visualizations in order to extract meaningful patterns about parking in different neighborhoods of the city.

If feasible, I will try to build an app using django in order to visualize trends of parking tickets for different neighborhoods and during different timeframes.
